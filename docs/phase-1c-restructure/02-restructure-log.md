## Step 0 detail

**What changed in the code:**

- `server.ts` `performDatabaseBackup()`: the `users` table is no longer read, and the destination is `process.env.BACKUP_DIR` with **no default**. If `BACKUP_DIR` is unset the backup is skipped with a warning, and if it resolves to a path inside the repository the backup is skipped as well. Previously it wrote to `scratch/backups/` on startup and every 6 hours (C-01, C-03).
- `.gitignore`: added `scratch/backups/` and `pending_registrations.json` (M-19).
- `.env.example`: created, variable **names** only, including the new `BACKUP_DIR` (C-07).
- Untracked with `git rm --cached`: 113 files under `scratch/backups/` and `pending_registrations.json`. **The files remain on disk**, they are only removed from git tracking.

**Verified:** `npm run build` passes. `npx tsx server.ts` starts and listens on port 4000. No new backup file was written during that run (the folder still holds the same 113 files).

**Not verified:** the "Backup skipped" log line was not observed at runtime, because `assertDefaultCustodianExists()` runs before the backup in the startup callback and hangs without database access from this machine. The guard is the first statement in the function, before any Prisma call, and no file was written, which is the outcome that matters.

---

## Step 1 detail

**What changed:** `tsconfig.json` created at the root, and a `typecheck` script (`tsc --noEmit`) added to `package.json`. Nothing moved and no application code changed.

**Config choices worth knowing:**

- `strict: false` for now, as 01D step 1 specifies. Turning it on is a separate, later decision; it would add a large number of errors at once.
- Path aliases: `@/*` (the existing Vite alias, kept so nothing breaks), plus `@server/*`, `@web/*`, and `@shared/*` ready for steps 3, 8, and 10. Pointing an alias at a folder that does not exist yet is harmless.
- No `baseUrl`. TypeScript 6 deprecates it and errors on it; `paths` resolves relative to this file without it.
- `allowImportingTsExtensions: true`, because [src/main.tsx:2](../../src/main.tsx#L2) imports `./app/App.tsx` with the extension. Vite supports that, so without this option the typecheck reported a false positive.
- `skipLibCheck: true`, standard practice, and it keeps `@types/react` v19 against the React 18 runtime (L-03) from filling the output with noise. That mismatch is still there and is not fixed here.
- Excluded: `node_modules`, `dist`, `scratch` (27 one-off scripts that are not part of the running app), and `legacy` (does not exist until step 2, and 01D says it stays out of the build).

**Baseline: 114 errors.** Keep this number from growing. By file:

| Count | File |
|---|---|
| 34 | `src/app/components/DirectorAnalyticsView.tsx` |
| 14 | `src/app/components/NotificationCenter.tsx` |
| 8 | `src/app/components/RoleAnalyticsModule.tsx` (quarantined in step 2) |
| 8 | `src/app/components/LabHeadAnalyticsView.tsx` |
| 8 | `src/app/components/AdRICDirectorDashboard.tsx` |
| 8 | `server.ts` |
| 7 | `src/app/components/AssetDetailModal.tsx` |
| 5 | `src/app/components/ITSDashboard.tsx` |
| 4 | `src/app/components/TSGAnalyticsView.tsx` |
| 4 | `src/app/components/ReportsAnalyticsDashboard.tsx` (quarantined in step 2) |
| 3 | `src/app/components/StudentAnalyticsView.tsx` (quarantined in step 2) |
| 3 | `src/app/components/AssetImagePlaceholder.tsx` |
| 3 | `src/app/components/AccountDetailsPage.tsx` |
| 2 | `src/app/components/LabHeadDashboard.tsx` |
| 1 | `test-user.ts`, `src/app/components/CustodianPortal.tsx`, `src/app/components/AssetCatalog.tsx` (last one quarantined in step 2) |

Most common codes: 49 of TS2339 (property does not exist), 37 of TS2322 (type not assignable, mostly `motion` animation `ease` strings), 10 of TS2367 (comparison that is always false), 9 of TS2551 (property misspelled, "did you mean").

**Step 2 should reduce this to about 98**, because 16 of the 114 are in the four files being quarantined and `legacy` is excluded from the typecheck.

**The typecheck independently confirms H-13.** It flags the exact lines 01B names: `ITSDashboard.tsx(1943)` `first_name` ("did you mean `firstName`"), `ITSDashboard.tsx(1973)` and `CustodianPortal.tsx(341)` `user_id` ("did you mean `userId`"). `test-user.ts(11)` confirms L-04. These are real, live bugs writing wrong data, and they were invisible before this step.

**Verified:** `npm run typecheck` completes and prints a list. `npm run build` still passes.

## Notes: noticed, deliberately not fixed

Kept here instead of being fixed, per 01D section 11 ("scope creep into Phase 3").

| Note | Finding | Where it belongs |
|---|---|---|
| The backup still covers only 4 of 15 tables (no `asset_records`, the table that holds custody state), so it could not actually restore the system. It is a partial export, not a backup. Deciding whether to keep it at all belongs with `server/jobs/backup.ts` | F-39 in 01A | Step 10, or delete the job |
| `pending_registrations.json` is now untracked but still the live store for pending sign-ups, holding a plaintext password per record | H-17 | Phase 3 (becomes a table) |
| `prisma.ts` still carries hardcoded connection fallbacks including a password. Step 0 did not touch them, because removing them without `server/config/env.ts` would break every teammate's setup with no replacement | C-07 | Step 10 (`server/config/env.ts`) |
| `npm ci` reports 11 vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 8 high) and 2 packages have install scripts not covered by `allowScripts` (`@prisma/engines`, `prisma`) | 01C section 7, tier 3 item 22 | Separate dependency pass |
| `node_modules` was absent in this working copy, so `npm ci` and `npm run prisma:generate` were run before anything could be verified. Worth knowing for the next session | n/a | n/a |
| `LabHeadDashboard.tsx` does call `GET /api/assets` (line 165, via a template string), so 01D's list of callers is correct. Recorded because an earlier quick grep suggested otherwise | n/a | n/a |
| 114 type errors now have names and line numbers, and none are fixed. The three worth fixing first are the H-13 ones, because they write wrong data today: two in `ITSDashboard.tsx`, one in `CustodianPortal.tsx` | H-13 | Its own `fix/h13-*` branch, not the restructure |
| 37 of the 114 errors are `motion` animation props (`ease: string` where the library wants a union). Cosmetic and safe, but they are more than a third of the count, so fixing them makes the real errors easier to see | n/a | Separate chore commit |
| `strict: false` is a deliberate starting point. Turning strict on is worth doing once the count is near zero, not during the move | H-13 | After step 9 |

**Note 1 (step 0):** no comment commit. `server.ts` is excluded from the comment pass because it is about to be split, and `.gitignore` and `.env.example` carry their own inline explanations.

**Note 2 (step 1):** no comment commit. The step created only `tsconfig.json` and edited `package.json`, both JSON, where TSDoc and file headers do not apply. The reasoning lives in this log instead.
